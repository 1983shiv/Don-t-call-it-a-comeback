							<h2>New CV, Who dis?</h2>
							<p>
								Good {greeting}, I'm Jack Pritchard, a passionate front-end
								website developer.
							</p>
							<p>
								I want to improve how businesses present themselves in the form
								of brand development and design.

								PHP, WordPress, Gatsby.
							</p>
							<p>Heck this site is built with most of those!</p>

								true passion lies in the front-end development. Turning designs
								into functional pages that represent brands or enable users to
								make use of web applications.
